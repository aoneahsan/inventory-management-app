  - Bulk operations
- **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Build runner needs to be executed to generate code

## üîß Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Fix Build Runner Issue
The build runner is failing due to dependency conflicts. To fix:

```bash
# Clean everything
flutter clean
rm -rf .dart_tool
rm -rf ~/.pub-cache  # Optional: complete cache clean

# Reinstall dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run build runner
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

If issues persist, try updating analyzer version in pubspec.yaml or removing conflicting packages temporarily.

### 2. Complete Firebase Setup
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project named "inventory-saas"
3. Run `flutterfire configure` in project directory
4. Select all platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
5. Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage in Firebase Console
6. Deploy security rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage
   ```

### 3. Test Basic Functionality
```bash
# Run on web
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=ENV=dev

# Run on iOS simulator
flutter run -d ios --dart-define=ENV=dev

# Run on Android emulator
flutter run -d android --dart-define=ENV=dev
