## Current Application State

### Working Features
1. **Application Launch**: App starts successfully on web
2. **Onboarding Flow**: New users are redirected to onboarding page
3. **UI Rendering**: Material Design 3 UI renders correctly
4. **Routing**: GoRouter navigation system is functional
5. **Database**: Local SQLite database initializes for web

### Application Flow

### Cypress Test Results
- Basic load tests: ✅ PASSED (all pages load without crashes)
- Detailed UI tests: ❌ FAILED (tests expect different routes/elements than current implementation)

   - Implement login page UI
   - Implement registration page UI
   - Add forgot password functionality

3. **Update Cypress Tests**
   - Modify tests to match actual application flow
   - Add test IDs to UI elements for better test stability
   - Account for onboarding flow in test scenarios

4. **Firebase Integration**
   - Configure Firebase project
   - Set up authentication
   - Enable Firestore database
   - Configure Firebase hosting

5. **Feature Implementation**
   - Complete remaining UI pages
   - Implement business logic
   - Add data synchronization

## Technical Debt Addressed
